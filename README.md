# Lokesh Photography Portfolio

A responsive one-page photography portfolio website designed to present:

- Nature photography
- City life photography
- Portrait shoots
- Event/live photography
- Real estate photography
- Collaboration opportunities with photographers and real estate agents

## Files

- `index.html` - Main portfolio page
- `styles.css` - Layout, colors, responsive UI, and component styles
- `script.js` - Mobile menu behavior, gallery filters, active nav links, dynamic footer year, and contact form mailto action

## Run locally

No build step is required. Open `index.html` directly in a browser.

If you prefer a local server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8080`.

## Customize quickly

1. Replace gallery image URLs in `index.html` with your own photos.
2. Update contact links and email (`hello@lokeshphotos.com`) with your real details.
3. Edit service descriptions and pricing text based on your current packages.
4. Update the "Start Here" cards so visitors are directed to your highest-priority offers.

## Suggested next improvements

- Add your real logo and social links
- Connect the form to a backend service (Formspree, Netlify Forms, or custom API)
- Add separate case-study pages for portraits and real estate projects
